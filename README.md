# Advent of code 2016

This repository contains my solutions for advent of code 2016. I used Pyhton to solve the puzzles. Each folder contains the two solutions for the daily puzzles. The puzzle input is also there in input.txt.

### Running the code:

    python d01/main_1.py

Please note that as it is a pet project, I'm trying my Python skills here. I'm trying to use fancy solutions, so the accent is not on readibility.
